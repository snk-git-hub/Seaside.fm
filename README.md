##🎙️ RiverSide.fm (aka Streamy McStreamFace)
"We didn’t reinvent the wheel. We just made it roll faster, look cooler, and maybe occasionally catch fire."

Welcome to RiverSide-ish.fm – a bold, slightly over-caffeinated attempt to clone (and eventually outshine ) Riverside.fm. This isn't just a front-end mockup. Oh no, my friend. We're going FULL STACK MADNESS – audio/video recording, processing, live studio vibes, cloud storage, user auth, and yes, even that annoying “your mic isn’t working” popup.

We’re not copying – we’re inspired with ambition. Think of this as Riverside’s younger cousin who lifts weights, writes poetry, and might start a podcast about AI and cat psychology.

 What Is This?
A clone of Riverside.fm built from scratch
