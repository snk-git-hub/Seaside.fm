# üéôÔ∏è RiverSide.fm

> _"Clone today, conquer tomorrow."_  

Welcome to **RiverSide-ish.fm** ‚Äì an ambitious full-stack clone of [Riverside.fm](https://riverside.fm), but with our own flavor and a healthy dose of caffeine-fueled chaos. We're not just replicating features ‚Äì we're building something so good it might make Riverside.fm a little nervous üëÄ.


Whether it stays a clone or evolves into a better, weirder, and way cooler podcasting platform ‚Äì we‚Äôre here for it.

 This is a **full system**, not just front-end fluff. Backend? Included. Real-time stuff? Oh yeah. Database? Of course. Brain cells? Slowly decreasing.

Why not?
