üéôÔ∏è How Riverside.fm Works (Overview)
Riverside.fm is a browser-based recording studio that allows you to record high-quality audio and video remotely with multiple participants. Its main features revolve around studio-grade recordings done over the internet.

üîß Key Features & How It Works Behind the Scenes
1. Local Recording (High Quality)
Unlike Zoom or Google Meet, which compress streams, Riverside records each participant locally on their own device.

Then, those recordings (up to 4K video and WAV audio) are uploaded in the background to the cloud (lossless quality).

This ensures no quality loss due to bad internet during the call.

2. Separate Tracks
Each participant‚Äôs audio and video are recorded on separate tracks.

This allows better post-production control (for cutting, balancing, and editing).

3. Progressive Uploading
While you're recording, the content is being uploaded continuously in chunks.

If the internet cuts out briefly, the recording doesn‚Äôt stop, and no data is lost.

4. Remote Guest Recording
Guests just need a browser (preferably Chrome) and a good mic/cam.

You send a link, they join the session, and Riverside handles recording their end.

5. Live Streaming & Producer Mode
You can live stream the session to YouTube, Facebook, etc.

A "producer" can join without being recorded to help guide the conversation.

6. Transcription & Editing Tools
Once recording is done, Riverside can transcribe the session using AI.

You can use its built-in editor to cut the video, create clips, and export in various formats (like social media snippets).
